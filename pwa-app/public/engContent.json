This painting, like many others, was covered over soon afterwards. Banksy’s poetic touch almost makes us forget the pessimistic vision that can be found in many of his works."},
            {"image":"THERE_IS_ALWAYS_HOPE.jpg", "audio": "THERE_IS_ALWAYS_HOPE.mp3", "title": "THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE", "shortDesc": "Originally appearing in London’s South Bank district, this work is without doubt one of Banksy’s most emblematic. There are many interpretations, but we agree that this young girl tries to catch or lets fly a red balloon in the shape of a heart (red is the only colour of this stencil). The balloon represents a symbol of fragility, innocence, hope, or love. Will she try to catch it, or will she let the balloon fly away?"},
            {"image":"SEASONS_GREETINGS.jpg", "audio": "SEASONS_GREETINGS.mp3", "title": "SEASON’S GREETINGS", "shortDesc": "Winter has settled in Wales. Children play in the snow. But, when you look at it more closely, you realise that it is not snowflakes that this child is trying to catch, but ashes from a burning container or rubbish bin. Banksy created this mural on the walls of a garage when Port Talbot was sadly ranked at the top of the most polluted places in the United Kingdom (WHO data): the steel industry was particularly active and present there."},
            {"image":"KISSING_COPPERS.jpg", "audio": "KISSING_COPPERS.mp3", "title": "KISSING COPPERS", "shortDesc": "Shake up the established order, provoke the well-meaning, but send a message that speaks to everyone: not for the first time, Banksy’s stencil created in the centre of Brighton made its way to be auctioned in 2014 in Miami for the sum of 520,000 euros (the buyer remained anonymous)."},
            {"image":"WELL_HUNG_LOVER.jpg", "audio": "WELL_HUNG_LOVER.mp3", "title": "WELL HUNG LOVER", "shortDesc": "Here Banksy plays with words and this double entendre: the title ‘Well hung’ literally means ‘hanging well’, but also refers in street language to a man who is well endowed. This stencil appeared on the wall of a sexual health clinic in Bristol in 2008. Banksy said later that he was not aware of the place where he painted it..."},
            {"image":"SMILEY_GRIN_REAPER.jpg", "audio": "SMILEY_GRIN_REAPER.mp3", "title": "SMILEY GRIN REAPER", "shortDesc": "Death, represented in different forms, is a recurring theme with Banksy. In this version, he adds a head in the shape of a yellow smiley to jostle us once again: by associating a sinister character with this rather sympathetic symbol from the rave culture of the 90s, he transports us between good and evil, and he makes fun of us, poor mortals and damned as we are. This mural is in the same neighbourhood where Banksy operated with his collective DryBreadZ Crew in its early days."},
            {"image":"BOMB_HUGGER.jpg", "audio": "BOMB_HUGGER.mp3", "title": "BOMB HUGGER", "shortDesc": "Banksy highlights the attraction of our modern societies for war, and in particular with these bombs manufactured by the largest factories in the United Kingdom and sold as toys worldwide. He condemns those who present war as an essential component of ‘democracy’ in order to promote (or export) freedom, democracy, and peace. Unless, as he adds on a hopeful note, love and innocence will overcome the warlike instinct of men."},
            {"image":"PISSING_SOLDIER.jpg", "audio": "PISSING_SOLDIER.mp3", "title": "PISSING SOLDIER", "shortDesc": "One of Banksy’s great strengths is his ability to use the environment and the context in which his stencils are created, not only to enhance his creations, but also to reinforce their impact. This is what he offers us here, with this street corner which is frequently witness to raucous nights and days, and with this wall used by some regulars, impatient to be able to relieve themselves. What strikes the eye of the passer-by is this artistic creation which mingles with an objective reality (a building, a wall, sounds, colours, smells, objects, etc.) to create a new reality. Add a character supposed to represent authority in an incongruous posture, and you will have the perfect cocktail of a nonconformist, reactionary Banksy."},

Banksy created this stencil on Easter Monday in 2011 on a wall in Fitzrovia, in central London. The blood-red colour is used for writing this sentence full of irony and also for the rat (Banksy’s favourite animal) which marks with its paw the authorship of this sentence."},
            {"image":"NO_BALL_GAMES.jpg", "audio": "NO_BALL_GAMES.mp3", "title": "No Ball Games", "shortDesc": "No Ball Games first appeared on canvas in 2006 during the Barely Legal exhibition, which Banksy was organising in the Skid Row area of downtown Los Angeles. Three years later, Banksy reproduced the work as a mural in Tottenham, north London, on a shop wall located at the junction between Tottenham High Road and Philip Lane. Later in 2009, Banksy published a signed edition of 250 prints of ‘No Ball Games’ on a background of green and grey blocks. In 2013, the Tottenham mural was removed from the wall by the Sincura Group. It was divided into three parts and sold for an estimated £500,000, which was used primarily to help disadvantaged children."},
            {"image":"SLAVE_LABOUR.jpg", "audio": "SLAVE_LABOUR.mp3", "title": "SLAVE LABOUR", "shortDesc": "Banksy painted this work around mid-May of 2012. A child, kneeling in front of a sewing machine, assembles banners made up of Union Jacks (the flag of the United Kingdom). Today there are still three possible interpretations of this stencil: the first would be a condemnation of the use of children in sweatshops for making goods (Banksy points the finger among others at the chain store Poundland). The second would be a satirical attack on the British monarchy and the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The Queen celebrated 60 years on the throne that year. Finally, the last interpretation would be directly linked to the organisation of the 2012 Summer Olympic Games which was to be held in London a few weeks later, and which in particular saw souvenir shops proliferating all over the city."},
            {"image":"THE_GRIN_REAPER.jpg", "audio": "THE_GRIN_REAPER.mp3", "title": "THE GRIN REAPER", "shortDesc": "Originally painted in 2003 on the side of Thekla, moored in the port of Bristol (which became a concert boat), this work was cut out in 2014 to be analysed and then kept in the M Shed Museum in Bristol. It is currently preserved there from deterioration and the wear of time."},

Here is the portrait of a maid called Leanne who cleaned my room in a motel in Los Angeles. She was a very courageous woman.’ - Banksy"},
            {"image":"SNORTING_COPPER.jpg", "audio": "SNORTING_COPPER.mp3", "title": "SNORTING COPPER", "shortDesc": "We thought it was long lost. This work, known as the Snorting Copper, shows a kneeling policeman snorting a line of cocaine. It appeared on the wall of public toilets in 2006, and was then vandalised, then covered up by local officials. It was the property developers who, after buying the building to turn it into homes and businesses, rediscovered the stencil. Once the decision was made to restore it, the wall was cut out, moved brick by brick to be restored by a specialist. After more than 4 months of work, the wall was cemented and reinstalled in its place of origin to the delight of the neighbourhood residents... and the police who, according to rumour, had already had fun at the time."},
            {"image":"KEITH_HARING_DOG.jpg", "audio": "KEITH_HARING_DOG.mp3", "title": "KEITH HARING DOG", "shortDesc": "The work shows a hooded man wearing dark clothes and a bandana hiding his face. Through this recurring visual, Banksy presents us a young, idle, and dissatisfied British youth. The threatening appearance of a man holding a large barking dog on a leash (a tribute to the famous Barking Dog by American artist Keith Haring) contrasts with his relaxed posture, his hand in his pocket. The contrast is also marked by the styles used: hyper realistic for the character and naive for the dog. According to Banksy’s own explanation, the dog has become a new weapon on the streets of the UK. In August 2016, the Plexiglas that had been installed to protect the work was gradually covered with posters and flyers, making the latter completely invisible. It is not known whether it is still in the same place."},
            {"image":"MOBILE_LOVERS.jpg", "audio": "MOBILE_LOVERS.mp3", "title": "MOBILE LOVERS", "shortDesc": "Two lovers, embracing, ready to kiss... And yet, they are much more interested in their phone than in this embrace which they will probably soon forget. Technologies are omnipresent in our societies, and little by little they engulf us and saturate the opportunities we have left to exchange and communicate. This is the message Banksy wants to send: he denounces our dependence on technologies (whatever they are) and puts his finger on our desires for hyperconnectivity, our needs for instantaneity and immediacy, to show us that the simplest and purest of relationships is no longer possible. Appearing on a door of the struggling Broad Plains Boys Club in Bristol, it was finally sold to a private collector for 470,000 euros in order to save the club from a closure that seemed inevitable."},
            {"image":"BURNING_TYRE.jpg", "audio": "BURNING_TYRE.mp3", "title": "BURNING TYRE", "shortDesc": "‘Dear Bridge Farm School, Thanks for your letter and naming a house after me. Please have a picture, and if you don’t like it, feel free to add stuff. I’m sure the teachers won’t mind. Remember, it’s always easier to get forgiveness than permission.’ A letter from Banksy to children at Bridge Farm Elementary School. The principal of the school thanked Banksy, assuring him that the work will be kept as it should be."}

A little higher, we find the champagne cork in full flight, piloted by a rat."},

It sits horizontally on his head, like Mickey Mouse ears. The rat also wears Minnie’s red bow with white polka dots, an ironic allusion to Disney. Have the revolutionaries of May 1968 become consumers on the payroll of large corporations?"},

Here, it is the painting ‘Bonaparte crossing the Great St. Bernard Pass’ (1800-1803) by Jacques-Louis David. In his version, Banksy retains the majestic posture of the horse, but Bonaparte is replaced by a character imprisoned in the emperor’s cloak. Some will interpret this work as ‘the blindness’ of the French authorities in the face of the migratory phenomenon."},

Nothing cruel you might say... except that the bone comes from the very paw of the dog."},
            {"image":"BATACLAN.jpg", "audio":"BATACLAmp3", "title": "BATACLAN", "shortDesc": "This stencilled work, which depicts a veiled person tilting her head, is the homage by Banksy to the victims and survivors of the terrorist attack of 13 November 2015 in Paris, during which IS militants killed 90 spectators at the Bataclan (concert and performance hall) and dozens of others across the city during various attacks and suicide bombings. ‘Banksy’s work, symbol of meditation and belonging to all: residents, Parisians, citizens of the world, was stolen from us.’ - we read on the Bataclan Twitter account on 26 January 2019."},

This work by Banksy is the most politically engaged among those he created in Paris. He painted it not far from the ‘Centre de Premier Accueil Humanitaire’ (First Humanitarian Reception Centre - closed by the State’s decision in 2018), and depicts a little girl who is trying to cover up a swastika. Naively, she thinks she can make disappear, with pastel pink and tapestry patterns, a Nazi cross very present and prominent."}

His date (one of the club’s dancers?) probably never came. The shutter was dismantled to be placed inside the club."},

Here he plays on words, images, and context at once: the term in English ‘Throw Up’ means ‘to vomit’ (here the boy vomits flowers with a bomb in his hand), but is also used in the graffiti art since it is a simplified representation of letters in a bubble (bubbleshaped letters that can be seen on the wall)."},

The dykes supposed to protect the city gave way, killing thousands of people and destroying as many homes and businesses. In 2008, the city then experienced the largest evacuation of people in the history of the United States under the threat of a new hurricane named Gustav. This young girl that Banksy painted in 2008 on a city wall, protects herself under an umbrella, but she realises that the umbrella itself is the cause of the falling rain. The parallel with the dikes of New Orleans is tragic evidence."},

It was restored and saved from a certain end (the plaster support on which it was painted was not going to last for long). It will be sold at auction (starting price 360,000 euros) and ended its journey with an anonymous buyer in Italy. It was replaced in Los Angeles, in the same place, by a stencil this time showing Pope Ratzinger, but with the same text as the original ‘I am out of bed and dressed. What more do you want?’ We don’t know if this new version was done by Banksy."},

It is obvious that this robot, a bomb in hand, could only paint on the wall one kind of tag: a barcode."},
            {"image":"LAUGH_NOW.jpg", "audio": "LAUGH_NOW.mp3", "title": "LAUGH NOW", "shortDesc": "Appearing for the first time on the wall of a nightclub in Brighton in 2002, this work and the character of the monkey has been used many times by Banksy. A perfect example of the dark humour he has shown since his beginnings, Banksy places his work between a critique of Man who enslaves other living beings and an alert about a rumbling revolution. Banksy shows this monkey, like the sandwich man carrying an ominous message: ‘Laugh now, but one day we’ll be in charge’. The reference to the Planet of the Apes (cult and undoubtedly contemporary film for Banksy) is quite obvious."},

We recognise the touch of the master of street art and his sense of humour. The Israeli (the soldier) and the Palestinian (the protester) could only fight in one way in this hotel room... with pillows!"},

In these territories between Israel and Palestine, which became one of his favourite stomping grounds, Banksy makes us understand that a more practical approach would be to do the reverse. The original work is topped with a graffiti: ‘Free Palestine’. Beyond the political message that leaves no room for doubt, Banksy invites us to look at the cultural barriers that prevent us from fully appreciating humanity in our neighbour."},

It is clearly a message of hope that Banksy addresses to the young generations and that he painted on the wall of Bethlehem. It is also a call to Palestinian children to live free one day, beyond barriers and borders."},
            {"image":"THE_ARMOURED_DOVE.jpg", "audio": "THE_ARMOURED_DOVE.mp3", "title": "THE ARMOURED DOVE", "shortDesc": "Like most of the works he created on the wall of Bethlehem or in the region, Banksy loudly shouts his opposition to this artificial barrier which he considers inhumane. The symbol is simple, but effective: a wall riddled with bullets, a dove with outstretched wings that we imagine is in flight, an olive branch in its beak and a bulletproof vest to protect itself. And as if a sniper was about to shoot him, a red target can be seen on its heart."},

Another example of what an irrational security policy some states can create. The theft of this mural raised many questions about artivism (compression of the words ‘art’ and ‘activism’) and the true ownership of street art works. It was allegedly detached from the wall by a Palestinian taxi driver who took offence, mistakenly believing that Banksy was comparing Palestinians to donkeys. But it turns out that this was not true, and that real commercial motives were behind this theft. The work was finally auctioned off in London for the sum of 225,000 euros in October 2015."},

However, it is a bouquet of flowers (the only part of this work in colours) that he is about to throw at the person who comes towards him, like a message of peace.

When feeding the infant the bottle of clearly marked poison, Banksy positions the viewer to feel that the child has no real control at that point in how her/his life will turn out. During the upbringing of the infant baby the circumstances and situations that surround her/ his early life create the path for adolescence and adulthood, and the person in society she/he will be."},

            {"image":"APPLAUSE.jpg", "audio": "APPLAUSE.mp3", "title": "APPLAUSE", "shortDesc": "An extremely witty critique of showbiz society of the spectacle, the planes taking off from an aircraft carrier are given “moral support” by a sign to elicit a round of applause from the paid viewers of a show in a TV studio."},
            {"image":"GOLF_SALE.jpg", "audio": "GOLF_SALE.mp3", "title": "GOLF SALE", "shortDesc": "This artwork by Banksy depicts a line of army tanks that are headed in the direction of a man who is holding a sign that reads “Golf Sale” with an arrow underneath, seemingly pointing to the direction of the sale. It references a protest against the Chinese government, when a protestor bravely stood in front of three tanks to stop them from passing. As they tried to move around him, he would once again stand in their way."},
            {"image":"KIDS_ON_GUNS.jpg", "audio": "KIDS_ON_GUNS.mp3", "title": "KIDS ON GUNS", "shortDesc": "Silhouettes of a young boy and a girl, holding their toys in hand, high up on a mountain of weapons, the girl is holding a heartshaped red balloon on a string. It is another work depicting his iconic balloon girl. The simplicity and severity of the colour contrasts give it both beauty and deeper meaning, making it one of the artists more sombre pieces."},
            {"image":"HAPPY_CHOPPER_CRUDE_OIL.jpg", "audio": "HAPPY_CHOPPER_CRUDE_OIL.mp3", "title": "HAPPY CHOPPER CRUDE OIL", "shortDesc": "It is known that Banksy used to buy artworks from the flea market and modifies oil paintings. The original renditions, usually pastiches of antique landscapes or classical portraiture, have been boldly over painted by the artist with quotidian contemporary iconography. Atop the gray steel hull of the lead chopper sits a yellow bow tie."},
            {"image":"GUANTANAMO_BAY.jpg", "audio": "GUANTANAMO_BAY.mp3", "title": "GUANTANAMO BAY", "shortDesc": "Banksy has placed Guantanamo Bay prisoners in many places but none has come closer to this exemplary piece of powerful juxtaposition in which the kneeling prisoner is overlooking a beautiful, idyllic painting of a seaside with almost hyper realistic crashing waves."},
            {"image":"DON’T_BELIEVE_THE_TYPE.jpg", "audio": "DON’T_BELIEVE_THE_TYPE.mp3", "title": "DON’ T BELIEVE THE TYPE", "shortDesc": "The words at the end of this piece “Please take your litter home,” is the most important commentary here, illustrating Banksy’s (and all graffiti/street artists for that matter) take on what public spaces are for, and what the establishment would like us to believe."},
            {"image":"FLOWER_THROWER.jpg", "audio": "FLOWER_THROWER.mp3", "title": "FLOWER THROWER", "shortDesc": "An uncanny amalgam of revolutionary violence and pacifist ardour, this work is possibly one of Banksy’s most renowned. The contrast between the figure in black & white and the colourful bouquet he holds in place of an alleged Molotov cocktail makes the piece even more poignant, engendering hope in the face of constant struggle, even if it may be violent."},
            {"image":"CND_SOLDIERS.jpg", "audio": "CND_SOLDIERS.mp3", "title": "CND SOLDIERS", "shortDesc": "It is rather fitting to see two heavily armed. soldiers in battle formation with one painting a peace sign on the wall. It serves as a reminder of how many of the 20th and 21st century wars have been waged in the name of peace and democracy."},
            {"image":"PULP_FICTION.jpg", "audio": "PULP_FICTION.mp3", "title": "PULP FICTION", "shortDesc": "As much as Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction is an outrageously humorous take on filmic violence, so is Banksy’s “Pulp Fiction”."},
            {"image":"NAPALM.jpg", "audio": "NAPALM.mp3", "title": "NAPALM", "shortDesc": "The terrifying photo of nine-year-old girl named Kim Phuc, taken during the Vietnam War (1972) is a blatant attack on consumerism and US Foreign Policy. Mickey Mouse and Ronald McDonald joyfully hold the little girl by the hand, almost seem arrogant in their smiles, while this poor girl is screaming, running and trying to get away."},
            {"image":"NO_BALL_GAMES.jpg", "audio": "NO_BALL_GAMES.mp3", "title": "NO BALL GAMES", "shortDesc": "This kind of dysfunctional sign exists all over the world, “No Ball Games”, an example of the kind of signs… That could frequently be found in North London, is representative of such laws that have no practical reality but are only there to irritate citizens."},
            {"image":"DISMALAND_EPHEMERA.jpg", "audio": "DISMALAND_EPHEMERA.mp3", "title": "DISMALAND EPHEMERA", "shortDesc": "A dismaying piece of art from Dismaland the Bemusement Park, one of Banksy’s shows."},
            {"image":"TROLLEYS.jpg", "audio": "TROLLEYS.mp3", "title": "TROLLEYS", "shortDesc": "In comparison with “Sale Ends Today”, “Trolleys” is more compassionate towards the consumer. At least it imbues Man with a certain power and more free will than the religious fervour towards consumerism that “Sale Ends Today” portrays."},
            {"image":"PARANOID_PICTURES.jpg", "audio": "PARANOID_PICTURES.mp3", "title": "PARANOID PICTURES", "shortDesc": "“Your mind works best when you’re paranoid. You explore every avenue and possibility of your situation at high speed with total clarity”. Banksy in Banging Your Head Against A Brick Wall."},
            {"image":"BARCODE_LEOPARD.jpg", "audio": "BARCODE_LEOPARD.mp3", "title": "BARCODE LEOPARD", "shortDesc": "Banksy has created an artwork that depicts an escaped tiger outside of his cage. The cage has been transformed into a bar code symbol, with the bars themselves being the bar code print."},
            {"image":"STICK_POLICE.jpg", "audio": "STICK_POLICE.mp3", "title": "STICK POLICE", "shortDesc": "The contrast between the elaborate physical movements that the police exhibit when in pursuit of a criminal is enough to make this piece brilliant. However, you can also see a ridicule of the ‘valiant’ efforts of the police in pursuing street artists, or anyone else for that matter: a caricature of the man on the street."},
            {"image":"KISSING_COPPERS.jpg", "audio": "KISSING_COPPERS.mp3", "title": "KISSING COPPERS", "shortDesc": "Another example of uniting the familiar with the completely unexpected."},
            {"image":"RUDE_COPPER.jpg", "audio": "RUDE_COPPER.mp3", "title": "RUDE COPPER", "shortDesc": "Rude Copper was Banksy’s very first commercial print, released in 2002 and like the name implies it is quite a provocative piece with an elaborate depth of field, in which the extended hand making the rude gesture takes center stage. It is Banksy’s first commercial print."},
            {"image":"MORONS.jpg", "audio": "MORONS.mp3", "title": "MORONS", "shortDesc": "“It seems to me the best way to make money out of art is not to even try. It doesn’t take much to be a successful artist—all you need to do is dedicate your entire life to it. The thing people most admired about Picasso wasn’t his work/life balance.” - Banksy, Village Voice 2013"},
            {"image":"RED_LENIN.jpg", "audio": "RED_LENIN.mp3", "title": "RED LENIN", "shortDesc": "This artwork is one of Banksy’s most widely recognized images. As mocking world leaders is part of Banksy’s works, this piece exemplifies how Lenin would look on roller skates, or waist up, with his extended hand in a revolutionary speech he could have been giving. One could also surmise a sense of “humanizing” the individual."},
            {"image":"GIRL_WITH_BALLON.jpg", "audio": "GIRL_WITH_BALLON.mp3", "title": "GIRL WITH BALLOON", "shortDesc": "Evocative and affectionate at first glance, “Girl with Balloon” throws the viewer off balance after the first impression of compassion wears off, has the girl released the balloon, having given up on along-lost love, or accepted that she needs to summit to the social order? Or has she lost grip of society, doomed to desperately seek that one feeling that is a human being’s primary need?"},
            {"image":"TURF_WAR.jpg", "audio": "TURF_WAR.mp3", "title": "TURF WAR", "shortDesc": "This artwork shows a famous portrait of Winston Churchill, made up into a punk rock icon with a green “tuft” of Mohican hair harks back to the May 2000 riots in London, known as the “Turf Wars.” A line of green grass cuts through the English bigwig, blurring the lines between sarcasm and political commentary. The clumps of grass that the protestors had dug up from Parliament Square have been delicately placed on Churchill’s head."},
            {"image":"SWEEP_IT_UNDER_THE_CARPET.jpg", "audio": "SWEEP_IT_UNDER_THE_CARPET.mp3", "title": "SWEEP IT UNDER THE CARPET", "shortDesc": "The London Maid may be Banksy’s maid in a hotel room in Los Angeles through the implications here once again resound with proverbial irony: Sweeping under the carpet, repressing illicit desires, only serves to bludgeon in the rejects of our unconscious into the building blocks, the firebrick and mortar wall, of the cities we live in. No matter how much we clean, or whom we employ to do so, the return of the repressed is inevitable, albeit disguised in the walls we live in between."},
            {"image":"MONKEYQUEEN.jpg", "audio": "MONKEYQUEEN.mp3", "title": "MONKEY QUEEN", "shortDesc": "Banksy’s use of the monkey as the Queen of England is either an extension of his monkeys rising to ever-higher ranks of power in human society or a derisive take on the English Monarchy."}
